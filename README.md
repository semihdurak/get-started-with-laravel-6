Laravel is an easy-to-learn framework for building web applications. And Laravel has become hands-down the most popular framework for writing apps with PHP. With the update to version 6, there's never been a better time to learn. 

In this course, Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to get started with Laravel 6. You'll start with the basics: installing Laravel and creating your first app with routes and view templates. You'll build from there, practicing skills like organizing your app code with controllers, saving data to a relational database, and validating user input.
